4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: The best model at classifying the four uploaded images would be Resnet. Although the Percent Match was similar between Resnet and Alexnet, Resnet spent 3 more seconds than Alexnet in classfying the images. With the extra 3 seconds, Resnet classification of the Dog_02.jpg was very close to the actual answer. It classifyied it as a 'malinois' breed which is similar to a German Shepherd unlike Alexnet which classfied it as 'border terrier'. So I would choose Resnet even though it might consume more time resources, it has a better chance of providing more accurate results.
